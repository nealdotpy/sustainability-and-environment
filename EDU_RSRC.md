# Introduction

Creating simple, yet compelling messages is becoming increasingly difficult to accomplish in a world filled with distractions. Even more so, technological literacy is accelerating. I firmly believe that within the next twenty years or so we will see the widespread acceptance of computer science fundamentals on a grade school level.

In one form or another, it will become paramount to teach students about programming, binary, and other basic computer science concepts in a similar fashion to how our pupils learn about fractions, infinity, limits, etc today.

This resource is meant to be a lightweight guide that assumes very little foundational knowledge. However, it will be written in a manner that would be suitable to the future generations. Perhaps it could even act as a time capsule, standing the test of time.  

If I was a maths teacher writing a mathematical resource in 2020, I would not start by explaining how counts of items can be abstracted by symbols we call numbers. Instead, I would simply begin by using those abstractions and talking about addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You need not mentally subtract 5 pencils from 2 pencils to obtain 3 pencils. Instead, you define these abstractions by their relation with each other. That is what empowers its usage.

I digress.
